# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Process

The html was altered without changing the content that the user views. The previous html had mostly div tags organizing the various segments of the document. 

The following steps were taken to improve the html.

1: The div with class "header" was changed to a header tag, and the css style sheet was updated to reflect this. <br/>
2: The two large content areas (classes "content" and "benefits") below the image were changed from divs to section tags. <br/> 
3: The individual items within the "content" section were changed to the article tag instead of div.  <br/>
4: The images and corresponding descriptions in the "benefits" section were changed from divs to figure tags  <br/> 
5: A footer tag was used to replace the div tag for the footer.  <br/>
6: A title (alt replacement for divs) was added to the div with the background image to allow for increased accesibility.  <br>
7: alt descriptions were added to the remaining images. <br/>
8: There was a lot of duplicate css that was commented away and consolidated into single sections. The original lines were kept but commented out in case individual seperate changes were desired later. <br/>
9: The title tag was changed from "Document" to "Horiseon".
